This is a list of Jupyter notebooks associated with StarNet to apply on SDSS APOGEE data.
 
They have been tested with python-2.7, some dependencies are not python-3 ready yet.

Required packages:
- numpy
- h5py
- random
- keras
- tensorflow or theano (backend for Keras)
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- jupyter
- vos

All those packages can be installed with pip.

```
pip install <package>...<package>
```
If you have the Python anaconda distribution, you can (except for `vos`) also install the packages not already installed with
```
conda install <package>...<package>
```

You can then clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/astroai/starnet.git
cd starnet
jupyter notebook
```
A new browser tab should pop up, if not, copy and paste the given link into your in your browser.

Before starting any of the other notebooks, be sure to read through 1_Download_Data.ipynb to find out what data you need for which notebooks.
 Not all of the available data is completely necessary depending on where you would like to begin, but reading through the notebooks will provide a more complete understanding of the necessary steps taken when creating a neural network model.

Below is a description of the available notebooks:
